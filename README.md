# Ledger Nano Hardware Interface
Cryptocurrency-oriented communities of both enthusiasts and developers alike have begun to embrace the potential of cold-storage wallets (AKA "hardware wallets") for enacting financial transactions while minimizing the risk of scams. In recognition to that same potential, ARCANE TECHNOLOGIESâ„¢ has been in the works for developing special software to interface with the most popular brands of said devices, namely Ledger Nano & Trezor products.

# Libraries
Ever since U2F-Transport was rendered deprecated, alternative technologies were developed for allowing interested programmers to develop and integrate their applications as to communicate with a hardware device. This instance makes use of the Node-HID Transport library to connect native device code with the interface code presented here.

Recommended packages built specifically for supporte cryptocurrencies are featured in code, also note here:
